= Installing the Knative Eventing Operator on OpenShift Container Platform

Knative Eventing can be installed by using the Knative Eventing Operator available on the OpenShift Container Platform web console.

IMPORTANT: This release is a developer preview and should not be used in a production environment.

IMPORTANT: With Knative 0.10.0 the Sources are now using the Destination API, and references to a `Sink` should be written as below. The old API still works, but was deprecated and will be removed in future releases.
